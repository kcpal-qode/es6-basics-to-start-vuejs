# Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous data synchronously. Before promises were introduced, JavaScript developers needed to use callbacks to deal with a function that relies on the completion of another function. A callback is a function passed to another function as an argument. Using promises, developers can now use the then() syntax to work with data returned by an asynchronous call. 


In Vuejs promises can be used in asynchronous request and can be used in conjunction with Async Components, as well as Vuex Actions.
